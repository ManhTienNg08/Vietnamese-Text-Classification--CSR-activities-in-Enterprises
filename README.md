# Vietnamese Text Classification: CSR activities in Enterprises
 
In this problems, we have to classify the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities from annual reports of each company (this project is only finished for the 30 Vietnamese banks).

There are 47 classes, divided into class 'No_CSR' and six main CSR topics:
- CSR activities for employees: 12 sub-topics
- CSR activities for communities: 5 sub-topics
- CSR activities for environments: 11 sub-topics
- CSR activities for suppliers: 3 sub-topics
- CSR activities for government: 7 sub-topics
- CSR activities for consumers: 8 sub-topics

We approached this problem by dividing it into three different problems:
1) Classify whether the sentence belongs to CSR or not.
2) Classify the sentence into big CSR topics.
3) Classify the sentence in each CSR topic into its smaller category.
